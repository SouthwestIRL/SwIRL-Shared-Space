# Changes

An approximate list of changes made since the project was delivered to SwIRL in early May 2022. Since the original group is not continuing development, the SwIRL version is in effect the true version. Never-the-less, we want to acknowledge changes made since the original app was developed for some period of time (probably about one year). This is mostly under the assumption that latter CSCE606 classes may be interested in picking up the work, and would find this information important.

1. Change Python Version from 3.6 to 3.9
